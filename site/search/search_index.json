MISRA C is a set of coding standards developed to ensure safety, security, and portability of C code, primarily used in automotive and embedded systems. \u2753 What is the role of a TLC file in MBD? TLC (Target Language Compiler) files define how Simulink models are translated into C code during the code generation process. \u2753 What is the difference between SIL and PIL testing? - **SIL (Software-in-the-loop)** simulates your code on a PC. - **PIL (Processor-in-the-loop)** runs the code on the actual hardware or target microcontroller. \ud83e\udded Tips !!! tip Use this site regularly to revise important technical concepts in a clean, distraction-free way. !!! note You can expand each topic from the side menu or click the links above to go directly to that section. !!! warning Don\u2019t forget to keep this repo private if it includes proprietary content or interview questions you've collected from work.
