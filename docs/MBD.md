## Sample Q&A

**Q1. What is the difference between MIL and SIL testing?**

**A:** MIL (Model-in-the-loop) testing is performed on the Simulink model, while SIL (Software-in-the-loop) testing is done using generated C code compiled and run on a PC environment.

**Q2. What is a TLC file and its role in code generation?**

**A:** TLC (Target Language Compiler) files define how Simulink blocks generate C code, and can be customized for target-specific code.

**Q3. How can you ensure model reusability in MBD?**

**A:** Use library blocks, masked subsystems, and referenced models for modularity and reuse.

**Q4. What are configuration parameters in Simulink used for?**

**A:** These define solver, data import/export, code generation, and optimization settings for a model.

**Q5. What are the advantages of Model-Based Design?**

**A:** Rapid prototyping, early validation, automatic code generation, and traceability.

**Q6. What are the common issues faced in MBD workflows?**

**A:** Integration of large models, tool compatibility, code traceability, and solver-related issues.

**Q7. How do you handle conditional execution in Simulink?**

**A:** Using enabled/triggered subsystems and switch/case blocks.

**Q8. What is signal logging in MBD?**

**A:** Capturing simulation signal data for debugging and analysis.

**Q9. What is model referencing and why is it used?**

**A:** It allows you to use a model inside another model for modular development and parallel team workflows.

**Q10. How do you test a Simulink model before code generation?**

**A:** Using simulation, assertions, test harnesses, and Simulink Test.
