**Q1. What is the difference between a masked subsystem and a library block?**

**A:** A masked subsystem encapsulates logic and hides complexity, while a library block is reusable across multiple models.

**Q2. What are solvers in Simulink?**

**A:** Solvers compute model outputs over time. They can be fixed-step or variable-step depending on system requirements.

**Q3. What is sample time and how is it configured?**

**A:** It defines when a block executes. It can be inherited, fixed, or triggered.

**Q4. How do you debug a Simulink model?**

**A:** Using breakpoints, scopes, data inspectors, and signal logging.

**Q5. What is Simulink Data Dictionary?**

**A:** It provides a centralized data management approach for models.

**Q6. What is the benefit of model referencing?**

**A:** Enables componentization and parallel team workflows.

**Q7. What are parameter tunings and how are they done?**

**A:** Parameters can be changed during simulation or runtime via Simulink Dashboard blocks or scripts.

**Q8. What does a Bus Creator do?**

**A:** Combines multiple signals into a single structured signal (bus).

**Q9. What is function-call subsystem?**

**A:** A subsystem that executes when a control signal triggers it.

**Q10. How do you avoid algebraic loops in Simulink?**

**A:** Use delays or memory blocks to break feedback paths.
