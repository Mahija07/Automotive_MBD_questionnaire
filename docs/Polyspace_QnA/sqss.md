# 📚 OVERVIEW 

### 💻 **What is Software Quality and Safety Standards in Automotive?**
<a class="back-sidebar-btn" href="javascript:history.back()">⬅️ Back</a>

**Software Quality and Safety Standards** are guidelines and frameworks used to **ensure the software in vehicles is reliable, safe, and performs correctly under all conditions**. Since vehicles now rely heavily on software (ADAS, ECUs, infotainment, etc.), ensuring quality and safety is *non-negotiable*.

### 📍 **Where and When is it Used?**

- **Where?**
  - In all **safety-critical automotive applications**:
    - Powertrain (engine control)
    - Braking systems (ABS, ESP)
    - ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems)
    - Autonomous driving
    - Airbag deployment
    - Lighting systems (e.g., you know this well 💡😉)
  
- **When?**
  - During **all stages** of the automotive software development lifecycle:
    - Requirements definition
    - Design
    - Implementation (coding)
    - Testing & validation
    - Deployment
    - Maintenance & updates

### 🔍 **Why Do We Use It?**

To ensure:
- **Safety**: No harm to driver, passengers, or pedestrians.
- **Reliability**: System behaves as expected under all conditions.
- **Compliance**: Meet global automotive regulatory standards.
- **Reduced recalls** and **customer complaints**.
- Avoid **legal and financial liabilities** from system failures.

### ⚙️ **How Do We Use It?**

By applying:
- ✅ **Standards** like:
  - **ISO 26262**: Functional Safety for Road Vehicles.
  - **ASPICE (Automotive SPICE)**: Software process assessment model.
  - **MISRA C**: Guidelines for safe C programming.
  - **ISO/SAE 21434**: Cybersecurity in automotive.
  - **AUTOSAR**: Standard software architecture.
  
- ✅ **Tools** like:
  - **Polyspace**: For static code analysis (to catch run-time errors early).
  - **SonarQube**: For code quality and maintainability.
  - **LDRA**, **QAC**, **VectorCAST**, etc.
  - Unit testing frameworks like **Google Test**, **Cantata**, etc.
