**Q1. What is the role of RTE in AUTOSAR?**

**A:** RTE (Run-Time Environment) is the middleware between application software components and the basic software.

**Q2. How is an RTE generated?**

**A:** It is generated from ARXML files using AUTOSAR tools like DaVinci Developer.

**Q3. What are Sender-Receiver and Client-Server interfaces?**

**A:** Sender-Receiver is for asynchronous data communication; Client-Server is for synchronous service calls.

**Q4. How are ports defined in RTE?**

**A:** Using Port Prototypes in SWCs for input/output and service access.

**Q5. What are runnable entities?**

**A:** Functions triggered by events like timing or data reception.

**Q6. What is the significance of ARXML files?**

**A:** They contain metadata for software and system configuration.

**Q7. How is timing behavior handled in RTE?**

**A:** With periodic or event-driven triggers configured in the BSW scheduler.

**Q8. What is an ECU Extract?**

**A:** A collection of ARXMLs representing the software stack and mappings for an ECU.

**Q9. How do you trace signal flow in RTE?**

**A:** Using signal mapping between PPort and RPort and examining ARXML definitions.

**Q10. What tools are commonly used for RTE?**

**A:** Vector DaVinci Developer, Elektrobit Tresos, and ARXML viewers.
