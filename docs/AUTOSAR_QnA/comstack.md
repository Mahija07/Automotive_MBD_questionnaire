<a class="back-sidebar-btn" href="javascript:history.back()">‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back</a>

The **COM Stack** in AUTOSAR is a layered software architecture that handles communication within the ECU and between ECUs over vehicle networks like CAN, LIN, FlexRay, and Ethernet.

It enables reliable, abstracted, and standardized data exchange across the vehicle‚Äôs distributed architecture.

---

### üìç Where is the COM Stack Used?

- Inside the **Basic Software (BSW)** layer of AUTOSAR
- Across all automotive ECUs for transmitting/receiving data over communication buses like CAN, LIN, etc.

---

### ‚è∞ When is COM Stack Used?

- During runtime when SWCs exchange messages
- In **diagnostics, signal transmission**, service communications, etc.
- During **vehicle operation**, especially in distributed systems like powertrain, ADAS, body control, etc.

---

### ‚ùì Why Use the COM Stack?

- To enable **seamless, standard, and scalable** communication across heterogeneous ECUs.
- To abstract hardware/network-specific details from the application/SWC layer.
- For **efficiency, fault tolerance**, and **standardization** in OEM-tier1 collaboration.

### üß© How is the COM Stack Structured?

The AUTOSAR COM Stack includes layers:

1. **Application Layer (SWCs)** ‚Äì Sends/receives signals via RTE  
2. **RTE (Runtime Environment)** ‚Äì Connects SWCs with COM module  
3. **COM Module** ‚Äì Packs/unpacks signals into PDUs  
4. **PDU Router (PduR)** ‚Äì Routes messages to appropriate lower modules  
5. **Bus-Specific Interface** ‚Äì E.g., CAN Interface  
6. **Bus Driver** ‚Äì E.g., CAN Driver  
7. **MCAL** ‚Äì Microcontroller-specific abstraction

### ‚úÖ Benefits of the COM Stack:

- üß† Hardware independence for application software  
- üöó Supports multiple vehicle networks (CAN, LIN, FlexRay, Ethernet)  
- üîÑ Reliable and deterministic communication  
- üì¶ Signal-to-PDU packing/unpacking optimization  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Simplifies debugging and testing  
- üåê Supports diagnostic and service communication

Yes, using "triggeredOnChange" setting.

**28. What is "signal timeout"?**  
Defines how long a signal can remain unchanged before it's considered invalid.

**29. What happens if a signal is missed?**  
COM Stack can notify or handle it as an error, based on configuration.
