## üí° AUTOSAR Architecture ‚Äì Layers Overview

AUTOSAR (Classic Platform) is designed in a **layered architecture** to separate concerns and standardize interaction between application software and hardware.

Here are the **main layers**:

---

### 1. **Application Layer**
- **What it is:** Contains all **Application Software Components (SWCs)**.
- **Function:** Each SWC performs specific functions like controlling lights, wipers, or airbags.
- **Independence:** SWCs are hardware-independent and communicate via ports and interfaces.
- **Example:** A LightControl SWC sends signal to the Body Control Module.

---

### 2. **Run-Time Environment (RTE)**
- **What it is:** Acts as a **middleware** between Application Layer and Basic Software (BSW).
- **Function:** Maps data and service communication between SWCs and BSW modules.
- **Generated by tools** based on software architecture.
- **Think of it as:** A **router** that connects components.

---

### 3. **Basic Software (BSW)**
This is the backbone of AUTOSAR and has 3 sub-layers:

#### a. **Service Layer**
- Provides **system services** like:
  - Memory management
  - Diagnostic services
  - OS abstraction
  - Communication services

#### b. **ECU Abstraction Layer**
- Makes higher layers **independent of the ECU hardware**.
- Provides uniform APIs to access internal/external peripherals.

#### c. **Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL)**
- The **lowest software layer**.
- Directly interfaces with microcontroller hardware (ADC, GPIO, SPI, etc.).
- Provides **standardized APIs** for upper layers.

---

### 4. **Microcontroller Layer**
- The **actual hardware** of the ECU.
- Contains CPU, memory, timers, peripherals, etc.
