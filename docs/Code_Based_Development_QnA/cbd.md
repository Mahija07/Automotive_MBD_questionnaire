### **What is CBD (Code-Based Development)?**  
CBD refers to the traditional approach of developing software by writing code manually in languages like **C or C++**, without relying on automatic model-based generation (like Simulink/TargetLink in MBD). It's where you *build software logic line-by-line*, manage memory, I/O, interrupts, protocols, and everything by hand.

### âœ… **Where and When Do We Use Code-Based Development?**

You should use Code-Based Development when:
- **Precise control over the implementation** is needed.
- The project is **low-level, performance-critical**, or hardware-dependent.
- **Legacy systems** or existing codebases are written in C/C++.
- You need to meet strict **memory, timing, or safety** constraints.
- **Modeling is unnecessary or overkill**, e.g., for utility drivers, bootloaders, communication stacks (like CAN or LIN drivers), or RTOS scheduling.

**Why use CBD?**  
- Provides **maximum flexibility**  
- Needed when tools like Simulink or SCADE are not feasible  
- Allows use of **existing legacy code or modules**  
- Helps in **debugging hardware-specific issues**  
- Gives **hands-on visibility and control** over whatâ€™s happening inside the ECU

**When do we use CBD?**  
- When **fine-grained control** over memory, timing, and hardware is required  
- For **performance optimization** (manual tuning vs. tool-based auto-code)  
- In **early project phases**, before modeling is ready  
- For **reusable libraries**, utilities, or protocol-specific stacks  
- When developing **custom features** or interfacing with **non-AUTOSAR hardware**

**Where is CBD used?**  
- **Automotive Embedded Systems** (especially for safety-critical or performance-sensitive ECUs)  
- **Low-level software development** (e.g., MCAL, OS, Drivers)  
- **Middleware development** (BSW modules, bootloaders, protocol stacks)  
- **Legacy systems** or ECUs where model-based tools arenâ€™t suitable or cost-effective  
- **Integration layers** like RTE adaptations or diagnostic layers (e.g., DCM, DEM)

Avoid dynamic memory (malloc/free); use static or stack-based allocation. Ensure variables are initialized and avoid memory leaks.

**8. What is volatile keyword in embedded C?**\
It tells the compiler that a variable can be changed unexpectedly, often used for memory-mapped I/O or flags set by interrupts.

**9. What is the difference between const and #define?**

- `const`: Type-safe, has scope, and uses memory.
- `#define`: Preprocessor directive, no type, replaces text before compilation.

**10. What is a watchdog timer?**\
A hardware timer that resets the microcontroller if the software becomes unresponsive or stuck in a loop.

**11. Explain ISR (Interrupt Service Routine).**\
An ISR is a function that executes when a specific interrupt occurs. It should be short and fast, avoiding blocking or long computations.

**12. What is the purpose of startup code in embedded systems?**\
It initializes the stack, heap, and data sections before calling `main()`. It's often provided by the compiler toolchain.

**13. How do you interface with hardware peripherals in C?**\
By accessing memory-mapped registers through pointers to specific addresses defined in the microcontrollerâ€™s datasheet.

**14. What is a linker script and why is it used?**\
It tells the linker how to arrange code and data in memory. Crucial for placing code/data in the right sections (flash, RAM).

**15. What is the use of extern keyword in C?**\
Used to declare a global variable or function in another file, enabling cross-file access.

A Real-Time Operating System is used when multiple tasks need deterministic scheduling, resource sharing, and timing guarantees.

**18. What is task prioritization in RTOS?**\
Each task is assigned a priority; higher priority tasks preempt lower ones. Proper priority assignment is crucial for system responsiveness.

**19. How do you implement delay in embedded C without blocking execution?**\
Using timer interrupts or tick counters instead of delay loops like `for` or `while`.

**20. What is a memory map and why is it important?**\
A memory map shows how memory is organized (flash, RAM, registers). It helps in efficient and safe memory usage.

**21. What is bit manipulation and why is it important in embedded systems?**\
Bit manipulation involves operations like setting, clearing, toggling, or checking bits. It's crucial for controlling hardware registers and flags efficiently.

**22. What is a circular buffer and where is it used?**\
A circular buffer is a fixed-size buffer that wraps around when full. It's used in UART communication, data logging, and producer-consumer applications.

**23. What is the purpose of the `static` keyword in C?**\
It can limit the scope of a function/variable to its file or retain a variableâ€™s value between function calls when used inside functions.

**24. How do you manage concurrency in embedded systems?**\
Using mechanisms like mutexes, semaphores, and disabling/enabling interrupts to prevent race conditions and ensure thread safety.

**25. What is a bootloader in embedded systems?**\
A bootloader is a small program that loads the main application code after power-up and may also support firmware updates.

**26. Explain endianess and how you handle it.**\
Endianess refers to the byte order in memory: Little-endian stores LSB first, Big-endian stores MSB first. Handle using portable code and conversion functions.

**27. What is the role of a makefile in embedded development?**\
Makefiles automate the build process by specifying how to compile and link the program using defined rules and dependencies.

Flash (program storage), SRAM (data RAM), EEPROM (non-volatile data), and Registers (control/configuration).

**29. How do you debug embedded software?**\
Using tools like JTAG/SWD debuggers, serial output, LED toggling, or logic analyzers to trace and fix bugs.

**30. What is the difference between blocking and non-blocking code?**\
Blocking code halts further execution until completion. Non-blocking code allows multitasking or interrupt-driven behavior for better responsiveness.

**31. What is latency and how do you minimize it?**\
Latency is the delay between an event and response. Minimize it using fast ISRs, proper task prioritization, and lightweight code.

**33. What is a soft real-time vs hard real-time system?**\
- Hard real-time: Missing deadlines causes system failure.
- Soft real-time: Occasional deadline misses are acceptable.

**34. What are interrupts and how are they prioritized?**\
Interrupts are signals that pause normal execution to handle urgent tasks. They are prioritized by hardware NVIC or software configuration.

**35. How do you avoid priority inversion?**\
By using priority inheritance protocol or carefully assigning priorities and using proper synchronization mechanisms.

**36. What is DMA (Direct Memory Access)?**\
DMA allows peripherals to read/write memory without CPU intervention, improving performance for large data transfers.

**37. What is debouncing and how is it implemented?**\
Debouncing is filtering noise or repeated transitions in mechanical switches. Implemented using delays, counters, or software filters.

It enables updating device firmware remotely via a wireless network. Used for maintenance and feature upgrades.

**41. What are startup files in embedded systems and what do they do?**\
Startup files set up the runtime environment, including stack pointers, interrupt vectors, and initialization of variables before calling `main()`.

**42. How do you measure execution time of code in embedded systems?**\
Using hardware timers, toggling GPIO pins measured by an oscilloscope, or using profiling tools provided by IDEs.

**43. What is the difference between timer and counter in microcontrollers?**\
A timer counts internal clock ticks; a counter counts external events (pulses). Both help in time-based operations.

**44. What is interrupt latency?**\
The time from when an interrupt occurs to when the CPU starts executing its ISR. It should be minimal for real-time systems.
