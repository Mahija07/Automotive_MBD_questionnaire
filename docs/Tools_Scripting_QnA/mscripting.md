### üí° **What is M-Scripting (MATLAB Scripting)?**
<a class="back-sidebar-btn" href="javascript:history.back()">‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back</a>

M-scripting refers to writing code in **MATLAB using `.m` files**, which include scripts and functions. It allows for:
- Data processing
- Algorithm development
- Simulation automation
- Plotting & visualization
- Model control (e.g., running Simulink models via script)

---

### üìç **Where is it used?**

- Controlling **Simulink** model simulations
- Automating **test cases** (MIL/SIL)
- Post-processing results (e.g., signal logs, plots)
- Writing reusable utility functions
- Performing **batch regression tests**
- Creating **configuration scripts** for automotive domains

---

### üìÖ **When do we use it?**

- During **model development**
- For **automated testing pipelines**
- To **generate and document results**
- When building toolchains for **code generation, verification**

---

### ‚ùì **Why use M-scripts?**

- **Automation:** Run tasks, load data, execute models without GUI
- **Customization:** Build test frameworks and utilities
- **Reusability:** Define functions for common engineering operations
- **Efficiency:** Avoid repetitive manual actions

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How do we use it?**

- Create `.m` files with code and logic
- Use control structures (`if`, `for`, `while`)
- Interface with Simulink models using `set_param`, `sim`, `get_param`
- Perform data handling using tables, matrices, cell arrays, structs
- Integrate with toolboxes or use for test automation

### üåü **Benefits**

‚úÖ Simplifies repetitive tasks  
‚úÖ Helps in building test frameworks  
‚úÖ Makes simulation runs reproducible  
‚úÖ Enables clean and structured development  
‚úÖ Easy to integrate with CI/CD and test tools like Jenkins or JIRA  
‚úÖ Great for logging, visualization, post-analysis

### **MATLAB M-Scripting Interview Q&A **

---

**1. What is an M-script in MATLAB?**  
A script written in a `.m` file that contains a sequence of MATLAB commands.

**2. How is an M-script different from a function?**  
Scripts don‚Äôt take inputs or return outputs; functions do.

**3. How do you create an M-script?**  
Create a new `.m` file and save it with your code.

**4. What command is used to run an M-script?**  
Just type the file name (without `.m`) in the command window.

**5. What is the command to run a Simulink model from a script?**  
`sim('modelName')`

**6. How do you automate test cases using scripts?**  
By looping through test inputs and calling Simulink models with `sim()`.

**7. What function is used to set parameters in a Simulink model?**  
`set_param()`

**8. What is `get_param()` used for?**  
To retrieve model, block, or signal parameters.
