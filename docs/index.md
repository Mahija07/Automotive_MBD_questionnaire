## 💡 Sample Q&A Highlights

Click to view answers 👇

<details>
<summary><strong>❓ What is MISRA C?</strong></summary>

MISRA C is a set of coding standards developed to ensure safety, security, and portability of C code, primarily used in automotive and embedded systems.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>❓ What is the role of a TLC file in MBD?</strong></summary>

TLC (Target Language Compiler) files define how Simulink models are translated into C code during the code generation process.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>❓ What is the difference between SIL and PIL testing?</strong></summary>

- **SIL (Software-in-the-loop)** simulates your code on a PC.
- **PIL (Processor-in-the-loop)** runs the code on the actual hardware or target microcontroller.
