### 🔹 **Basic Level: Simulink Fundamentals**

**1. What is Simulink, and how is it different from MATLAB?**  
Simulink is a graphical environment for modeling, simulating, and analyzing dynamic systems. Unlike MATLAB, which is text-based, Simulink uses block diagrams to represent systems.

**2. What are the core components of a Simulink model?**  
Blocks, signals (lines), subsystems, ports (Inport/Outport), solver configuration, configuration parameters.

Scope displays signal waveforms over time, while Display shows the current value of a signal numerically.

**4. What is a virtual subsystem in Simulink?**  
A virtual subsystem is used for visual organization. It does not affect simulation execution order or code generation.

**5. What is a non-virtual (atomic) subsystem, and when is it used?**  
An atomic subsystem executes as a single unit. It’s used when you need controlled execution order or modular code generation.

**6. What is the role of Inport and Outport blocks?**  
They define interfaces for subsystems and models, allowing data to enter and exit models or components.

**7. How do you model conditional logic in Simulink?**  
Using blocks like Switch, Multiport Switch, If-Else subsystems, or Stateflow for complex logic.

**8. What is the purpose of the Signal Builder block?**
