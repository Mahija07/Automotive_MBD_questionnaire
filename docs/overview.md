## 🚗 END-TO-END VEHICLE DEVELOPMENT & OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW

---

### 🧩 1. **Requirement Gathering (What & Why)**

#### 📌 Goal:
Capture what the vehicle should *do* from a feature/function perspective.

#### 🧠 Sources of Requirements:
- Customer needs
- Regulatory compliance (e.g., ISO 26262 for safety)
- Market trends (ADAS, EV, connectivity)
- OEM strategy

#### 🛠 Types:
- **System Requirements**: e.g., “Vehicle shall have Lane Keep Assist”
- **Software Requirements**: e.g., “If deviation > 0.5m, trigger correction signal”
- **Hardware Requirements**: e.g., “ECU must have at least 2 CAN transceivers”

---

### 🧠 2. **System Architecture Design (When & Where)**

#### 📌 Goal:
Translate requirements into system-level functional blocks and architecture.

#### 👷‍♀️ Involves:
- **Functional Decomposition** into vehicle domains (e.g., powertrain, body, ADAS)
- **Allocation of features to ECUs**
- **Signal mapping** across sensors, ECUs, actuators
- **Selection of communication protocols** (CAN, LIN, FlexRay, Ethernet)

📌 *Tool Examples*: MagicDraw, Enterprise Architect, SystemDesk

---

### ⚙️ 3. **Software & ECU Architecture Design**

#### 📌 Goal:
Design ECU-level and software-layer implementations.

#### 🔧 Steps:
- Define **ECU-level functional architecture**
- Use AUTOSAR architecture: Application, RTE, BSW
- Create **software component (SWC)** definitions
- Configure services (diagnostics, communication, OS)

📌 *Tool Examples*: DaVinci Developer/Configurator, EB Tresos, Arctic Studio

---

### 👩‍💻 4. **Model-Based Development (Simulink/Stateflow)**

#### 📌 Goal:
Implement and simulate feature logic before generating code.

#### 🧱 Tasks:
- Create **Simulink/Stateflow** models per SWC
- **Run MIL (Model-in-the-loop)** simulations
- Perform **unit testing** & verification (e.g., using GTest, SIL, PIL)
- Ensure **code generation** is compliant (e.g., MISRA C)

📌 *Tools*: Simulink, Embedded Coder, TargetLink, Polyspace, SCADE

---

### 🧪 5. **Integration, Testing & Validation**

#### 🔌 Integration Types:
- **Component Integration**: Combine multiple SWCs
- **ECU Integration**: Software + OS + BSW
- **System Integration**: All ECUs in bench or vehicle

#### 🧪 Test Levels:
- MIL → SIL → PIL → HIL → Vehicle
- **Diagnostics Testing**, **Fault Injection**, **Black Box Testing**

📌 *Tools*: CANoe, CANalyzer, VT Systems, dSPACE, GTest, JIRA, Jenkins

---

### 🔄 6. **Communication Middleware & Stacks**

#### 📡 Middleware Setup:
- CAN/LIN/FlexRay/Ethernet stacks configured (via tools like Vector GENy)
- Set up **PDUs, signals, DBCs, AUTOSAR COM**
- **RTE** maps software ports to actual ECU interfaces

---

### 🧵 7. **Code Deployment & Flashing**

- Flash compiled HEX/SREC/BIN files onto ECU
- Validate flashing using checksum tools, bootloaders
- Run diagnostics to confirm correct image

📌 *Tools*: UDE, Vector Flash Tool, OEM-specific bootloaders

---

### ⚙️ 8. **Boot-Time Initialization & Configuration**

When the vehicle starts:
- ECUs boot (RTOS or Linux)
- Initialize drivers, memory, communication stacks
- Establish handshake protocols (e.g., UDS session control)

---

### 🔁 9. **Run-Time Vehicle Operation Flow**

Let’s walk through an example: **“Turn on Headlight via Switch”**  
_(Apply this structure to any feature like braking, steering assist, infotainment)_:

#### 1️⃣ User flips headlight switch → input captured by HMI ECU  
#### 2️⃣ HMI ECU sends signal over CAN  
#### 3️⃣ BCM (Body Control Module) receives and processes the signal  
#### 4️⃣ BCM runs logic (from SWC) → output signal triggers GPIO  
#### 5️⃣ GPIO signal controls a **relay/actuator** connected to headlights  
#### 6️⃣ Headlights turn ON  
#### 7️⃣ BCM sends confirmation back over CAN (feedback loop)  
#### 8️⃣ Info displayed in instrument cluster (IC ECU)

---

### ⚡ 10. **Actuation & Feedback**

#### 🌟 Actuators:
- Electrical: Lights, wipers, mirrors
- Mechanical: Brake booster, EPS (electric power steering)
- Hydraulic: Transmission systems

#### 📈 Feedback Sensors:
- Position sensors, pressure sensors, radar/lidar, IMU
- Used for closed-loop control (PID, Stateflow logic)

---

### 🌐 11. **Vehicle Cloud/Connectivity (Microservices + OTA)**

For advanced ECUs:
- Adaptive AUTOSAR runs Linux/QNX
- Features as microservices (FOTA, analytics, V2X)
- ECUs communicate with cloud via Telematics Unit

---

### 🛡️ 12. **Safety, Security & Compliance**

- Safety: ISO 26262 → ASIL A-D ratings
- Security: Secure boot, OTA encryption, firewalls
- Compliance: ASPICE, AUTOSAR, ISO 21434 (cybersecurity)
