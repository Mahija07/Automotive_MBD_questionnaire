### Coverage Types in GTest:

1. **Statement Coverage (Line Coverage)**
2. **Branch Coverage (Decision Coverage)**
3. **Path Coverage**
4. **Condition Coverage**
5. **Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC)**

Each type of coverage ensures different aspects of the code are thoroughly tested.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Statement Coverage (Line Coverage)**

**What It Means**:  
This coverage type ensures that **every line of code** in the program is executed at least once during the tests.

**How to Achieve It**:
- Create tests that trigger every line of your function/method.
- Each line of your function should be executed by at least one test case.

**Example**:

```cpp
bool checkEngineStatus(int engineTemperature, bool engineRunning) {
    if (engineRunning) {
        if (engineTemperature > 90) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

To cover this:

1. **Test 1**: `engineTemperature = 100, engineRunning = true` ‚Üí hits line 3 and 4.
2. **Test 2**: `engineTemperature = 80, engineRunning = true` ‚Üí hits line 3 but not line 4.

By running tests that cover both the `if` conditions, you achieve **Statement Coverage**.

**Tools**:  
- Use **gcov**, **lcov**, or **Bullseye** to measure line coverage.
  
---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Branch Coverage (Decision Coverage)**

**What It Means**:  
This type ensures that **each decision point** (i.e., `if` or `switch` statements) takes on **both possible outcomes**‚Äîtrue and false.

**How to Achieve It**:
- Ensure that every **decision point** (condition inside an `if`, `while`, `switch`, etc.) evaluates to both **true** and **false**.

**Example**:

```cpp
bool isSpeedSafe(int speed) {
    if (speed > 120) {
        return false;  // dangerous
    } else {
        return true;   // safe
    }
}
```

To cover **branch coverage**:
- **Test 1**: `speed = 130` ‚Üí goes through the `if` block, evaluates to **false**.
- **Test 2**: `speed = 110` ‚Üí goes through the `else` block, evaluates to **true**.

**Tools**:  
- **gcov** or **lcov** will report branch coverage to show that both branches are tested.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Path Coverage**

**What It Means**:  
This type ensures that **all possible paths** through the code are exercised. This can become complex with multiple decision points (since it requires testing combinations of branches).

**How to Achieve It**:
- Identify all possible **paths** through the code, including combinations of decision branches.
- Create test cases to cover **each unique combination of decisions** (paths).

**Example**:

```cpp
bool shouldTurnOnLights(int timeOfDay, bool vehicleMoving) {
    if (timeOfDay > 18) {
        if (vehicleMoving) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

Paths:
- Path 1: `timeOfDay > 18` and `vehicleMoving = true`
- Path 2: `timeOfDay > 18` and `vehicleMoving = false`
- Path 3: `timeOfDay <= 18`

To cover **path coverage**:
- **Test 1**: `timeOfDay = 19, vehicleMoving = true` ‚Üí Path 1.
- **Test 2**: `timeOfDay = 19, vehicleMoving = false` ‚Üí Path 2.
- **Test 3**: `timeOfDay = 15, vehicleMoving = false` ‚Üí Path 3.

**Tools**:  
- **gcov** or **lcov** will help track which paths are covered.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Condition Coverage**

**What It Means**:  
This ensures that each **atomic condition** (in an `if` expression) is evaluated to both **true and false** at least once, regardless of the overall decision result.

**How to Achieve It**:
- Ensure that each **condition** in a compound decision (`&&`, `||`) is tested for both **true and false**.

**Example**:

```cpp
bool isEmergencyStopNeeded(int speed, bool brakePressed) {
    if (speed > 120 && brakePressed) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Test Requirements**:
- Condition 1 (`speed > 120`) ‚Üí tested for both **true** and **false**
- Condition 2 (`brakePressed`) ‚Üí tested for both **true** and **false**

**Test Cases**:
- **Test 1**: `speed = 130, brakePressed = true` ‚Üí tests condition 1 and 2 as **true**.
- **Test 2**: `speed = 80, brakePressed = true` ‚Üí tests condition 1 as **false**, condition 2 as **true**.
- **Test 3**: `speed = 130, brakePressed = false` ‚Üí tests condition 1 as **true**, condition 2 as **false**.

**Tools**:  
- **gcov**, **lcov** will also track condition coverage.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC)**

**What It Means**:  
MC/DC is a stricter form of coverage than **Condition** and **Branch Coverage**. It ensures that:
- Each condition **evaluates to both true and false**.
- Each condition's **independent effect** on the overall decision is validated (i.e., altering one condition changes the outcome).

**How to Achieve It**:
- Design tests to toggle one condition at a time while keeping others constant to show that each condition independently affects the decision.

**Example**:

```cpp
bool shouldDisableAutopilot(int speed, bool driverAlert) {
    if (speed > 120 && driverAlert) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

Here, we need to show that:
- `speed > 120` alone changes the result.
- `driverAlert` alone changes the result.

**Test Cases**:
- **Test 1**: `speed = 130, driverAlert = true` ‚Üí both true ‚Üí decision **true**
- **Test 2**: `speed = 130, driverAlert = false` ‚Üí changes **driverAlert** ‚Üí decision **false**
- **Test 3**: `speed = 80, driverAlert = true` ‚Üí changes **speed** ‚Üí decision **false**

**Tools**:  
- **gcov** and **lcov** can help generate MC/DC reports when testing individual conditions.

### How to Achieve GTest Coverage:

To use **Google Test** effectively for these types of coverage, you can integrate **code coverage tools** into your build system:

1. **Install Coverage Tools**:
   - **gcov** (GNU tool for coverage analysis)
   - **lcov** (GUI frontend for gcov)
   - **Bullseye**, **VectorCAST**, or similar tools

2. **Compile with Coverage Flags**:
   - When building the test binary, use the following GCC flags to enable coverage:
     ```bash
     g++ -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -o my_test_binary my_test.cpp
     ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   - Execute your GTest tests as usual. The coverage tools will record which parts of the code are exercised.

4. **Generate Coverage Reports**:
   - Use **lcov** or **gcov** to generate coverage reports:
     ```bash
     lcov --capture --directory . --output-file coverage.info
     genhtml coverage.info --output-directory out
     ```

5. **Visualize**:
   - View the HTML reports that show line coverage, branch coverage, and other metrics.
