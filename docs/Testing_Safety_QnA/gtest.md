### **Google Test (GTest) Interview Questions and Answers**

---

**1. What is Google Test?**  
Google Test is a unit testing framework for C++ developed by Google to test individual units of code.

**2. Why is GTest used in automotive software testing?**  
It validates logic modules like diagnostics, lighting control, etc., ensuring reliability and compliance with safety standards.

**3. What is a test fixture in GTest?**  
A test fixture is a class containing setup/teardown routines for multiple test cases that share common objects or configurations.

**4. How do you write a simple test in GTest?**  
```cpp
TEST(SampleTest, AdditionCheck) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}
```

**5. What is the difference between `EXPECT_` and `ASSERT_`?**  
`EXPECT_` continues after failure; `ASSERT_` stops the test at the failure point.

**6. Can GTest be used in embedded systems?**  
Yes, especially for logic that runs on-host before integration on-target.

**7. What is the role of `main()` in GTest?**  
It's required to initialize and run all test cases:
```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

**8. How do you group tests logically?**  
By using test fixtures or naming conventions in `TEST_F()` or `TEST_P()`.

**9. What‚Äôs `TEST_F()` used for?**  
It defines a test using a shared fixture class (i.e., common test setup/teardown logic).

**10. What is `TEST_P()` used for?**  
It‚Äôs used for parameterized tests to run the same logic with multiple input values.

**11. What is Google Mock?**  
A companion library for GTest to create mock objects and test interactions.

**12. How do you mock a method?**  
By creating a class using `MOCK_METHOD()` macros.

**13. Can you integrate GTest with CI tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions?**  
Yes, via command-line runners and test result parsers (e.g., XML).

**14. How do you skip a test temporarily?**  
Prefix the test name with `DISABLED_`.

**15. What is the benefit of using GTest in Test-Driven Development (TDD)?**  
It enforces writing testable, modular, and bug-free code from the start.

**16. Can you generate reports from GTest?**  
Yes, using `--gtest_output=xml:<file.xml>`.

**17. How do you pass command-line arguments to tests?**  
Use `InitGoogleTest()` to parse them.

**18. What‚Äôs the purpose of `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`?**  
They define actions before and after each test in a fixture.

**19. Can GTest be used for integration testing?**  
It‚Äôs mostly for unit testing but can be extended for lightweight integration.

**20. What‚Äôs the default test result format?**  
Console-based output with pass/fail logs.

**21. How do you run only a specific test case?**  
Use `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName`.

**22. How do you test exception handling in GTest?**  
Using `EXPECT_THROW()`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW()`, etc.

**23. What is `ASSERT_THROW()` used for?**  
To assert that a statement throws an expected exception and aborts if not.

**24. Can you use GTest with CMake?**  
Yes, it integrates seamlessly with `FetchContent` or `add_subdirectory()`.

**25. Can you write custom matchers?**  
Yes, using `MATCHER()` or by extending matcher classes.

**26. What is `EXPECT_NEAR()` used for?**  
To compare floating point values with tolerance.

**27. How do you test time-sensitive functions?**  
By mocking time or using time thresholds with `EXPECT_*` statements.

**28. What is `SUCCEED()` macro?**  
Used to mark a test as passed explicitly, helpful in complex logic.

**29. Can you create reusable assertions?**  
Yes, by wrapping checks in helper functions/macros.

**30. What is the lifecycle of a test fixture?**  
`SetUp()` ‚Üí test body ‚Üí `TearDown()`.

**31. How do you test private members?**  
By declaring tests as `friend class` or exposing them via interfaces.

**32. How do you avoid code duplication in test setup?**  
By using fixtures and helper methods.

**33. How do you parameterize tests?**  
Using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()` and `TEST_P()`.

**34. Can GTest tests be run in parallel?**  
Yes, but care must be taken with shared resources.

**35. How is GTest useful in code coverage analysis?**  
It helps generate coverage reports when combined with tools like gcov or lcov.

**36. Is Google Test platform-dependent?**  
No, it‚Äôs cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).

**37. Can GTest test multithreaded code?**  
Yes, though synchronization must be handled manually.

**38. How do you suppress output in GTest?**  
By redirecting stdout/stderr or using `--gtest_brief=1`.

**39. What is `OnTestStart()` hook used for?**  
To execute custom logic when a test begins (via event listeners).

**40. Can you nest test cases in GTest?**  
No, but you can organize using naming conventions and suites.

**41. What is `--gtest_repeat`?**  
A flag to repeat tests multiple times for stress testing.

**42. What is `--gtest_shuffle`?**  
It runs tests in random order to catch inter-test dependencies.

**43. What is a flaky test?**  
A test that fails intermittently. GTest helps isolate these.

**44. How do you mock global functions?**  
Use wrapper classes/interfaces and inject them for mocking.

**45. How do you test code that depends on hardware?**  
By mocking hardware interfaces and using simulation environments.

**46. Can you write tests for legacy code using GTest?**  
Yes, by isolating functionality or wrapping legacy APIs.

**47. What is `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ()`?**  
It checks if two C strings are equal, case-insensitive.

**48. How do you integrate GTest with Qt or ROS?**  
Using appropriate test runners and CMake integration.

**49. What is a death test?**  
A test that checks if code crashes or exits abnormally (e.g., `EXPECT_DEATH()`).

**50. How does GTest improve software quality?**  
By catching bugs early, enabling refactoring, and ensuring reliability.
