**Q3. What are the types of testing in automotive software?**  
**A:** Unit testing, integration testing, MIL, SIL, HIL, and acceptance testing.

**Q4. What is a safety goal?**  
**A:** A top-level safety requirement derived from a hazard analysis to prevent or mitigate risks.

**Q5. What is fault injection testing?**  
**A:** Deliberately introducing faults to verify system robustness and error handling.

**Q6. What is the role of Google Test in unit testing?**  
**A:** Google Test provides a C++ testing framework for writing and running automated tests.

**Q7. What is traceability in ISO 26262?**

**Q8. What are test coverage metrics?**  
**A:** They include statement, branch, and MC/DC coverage to ensure thorough testing.

**Q9. How is tool qualification addressed in ISO 26262?**  
**A:** Tools must be qualified if their malfunction could introduce or fail to detect errors in safety-related systems.

**Q10. What is Safety Element out of Context (SEooC)?**  
**A:** A reusable component developed independently of the target system but according to ISO 26262.
