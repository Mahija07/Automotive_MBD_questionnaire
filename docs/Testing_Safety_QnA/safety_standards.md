**1. What is ISO 26262?**  
A functional safety standard for automotive electrical and electronic systems.

**2. Why is ISO 26262 important?**  
It ensures the vehicle functions safely under both normal and fault conditions.

**3. What is Functional Safety?**  
The absence of unreasonable risk due to hazards caused by malfunctioning behavior of E/E systems.

**4. What are the major parts of ISO 26262?**  
It includes 12 parts, from vocabulary to hardware/software development, ASIL determination, etc.

**5. What is ASIL?**  
Automotive Safety Integrity Level ‚Äî defines risk levels (A to D) with D being the highest.

**6. What is HARA?**  
Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment ‚Äî used to determine ASIL and identify safety goals.

**7. What is a Safety Goal?**  
A high-level safety requirement derived from HARA to mitigate hazards.

**8. What is a Safety Case?**  
Documented evidence showing that safety goals are met and the system is safe.

**9. What is FMEA?**  
Failure Modes and Effects Analysis ‚Äî identifies potential failure points in a system.

**10. What is FTA?**  
Fault Tree Analysis ‚Äî top-down approach to identify causes of system failure.
 
**11. What is the V-model in ISO 26262?**  
A development process showing relationship between development and verification activities.

**12. What is the role of tool qualification in ISO 26262?**  
To ensure tools used in development don't introduce undetected errors.

**13. What is freedom from interference?**  
Separation of software components with different ASILs to prevent negative impact.

**14. What are safety mechanisms?**  
Software or hardware features that detect, prevent, or control failures.

**15. What are the software development phases in ISO 26262?**  
Initiation, specification, architectural design, implementation, testing.

**16. What is ASPICE?**  
Automotive SPICE ‚Äî a process improvement model for automotive software development.

**17. Difference between ASPICE and ISO 26262?**  
ASPICE focuses on process quality; ISO 26262 focuses on functional safety.

**18. What is a safety requirement?**  
A requirement created to mitigate risks identified during safety analysis.

**19. What is SOTIF?**  
Safety of the Intended Functionality ‚Äî ISO/PAS 21448 ‚Äî covers risks from system limitations, not failures.

**20. What is the role of MISRA C?**  
A set of C programming guidelines to ensure safe and reliable code in automotive systems.
 
**21. What are typical safety-related ECUs?**  
Airbag, ABS, ESP, ADAS controllers, engine control, etc.

**22. What is software verification in ISO 26262?**  
Ensures software meets its requirements through testing and reviews.

**23. What is hardware-software interface (HSI)?**  
Documentation describing interaction between hardware and software.

**24. What are confidence levels in tool qualification?**  
TCL 1‚Äì3: higher confidence required for more critical tools.

**25. Can ISO 26262 be applied to motorcycles?**  
Yes, through ISO 26262 Part 12 or extensions.

**26. What is a dependent failure?**  
A failure in one component causing another to fail ‚Äî must be analyzed and avoided.

**27. What is robustness testing?**  
Testing to ensure software behaves reliably under stress or faults.

Introducing errors to validate the system's fault detection and handling.

**29. What is a safety culture?**  
A company-wide mindset and practice focused on safety at every level.

**30. What are software safety requirements?**  
Detailed requirements derived from safety goals to be implemented in code.
