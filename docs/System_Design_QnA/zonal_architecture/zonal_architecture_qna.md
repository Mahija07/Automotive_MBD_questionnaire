<a class="back-sidebar-btn" href="javascript:history.back()">‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back</a>

Zonal Architecture is a next-gen design approach for vehicle electrical and electronic (E/E) systems. Instead of grouping ECUs by function (like body, chassis, infotainment), it groups them by **physical zones** in the vehicle (e.g., front-left, rear-right). Each zone has its own controller that connects local sensors and actuators to a central computing system.

### üìç Where is it used?

- In modern vehicles, especially **EVs** and **high-tech cars**.
- Common in OEMs like **Tesla, BMW, Mercedes**, and emerging EV startups.
