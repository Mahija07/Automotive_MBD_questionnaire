## Sample Q&A

**Q1. What is system integration in automotive software?**  
**A:** It involves combining software components and subsystems into a functioning whole, ensuring correct interaction and data exchange.

**Q2. What is PREEvision used for?**  
**A:** It is used for model-based wiring, network, and ECU architecture design.

**Q3. What role does MagicDraw play?**  
**A:** MagicDraw is used for system modeling, especially with SysML/UML diagrams, to design complex systems.

**Q4. What is the difference between logical and physical architecture?**  
**A:** Logical architecture defines functional blocks; physical architecture maps these blocks to hardware or ECUs.

**Q5. What is an example of a zonal module?**  
**A:** A zonal module could control multiple devices (lights, sensors) in a specific zone of the car, simplifying wiring and processing.

**Q6. What are communication matrix files?**  
**A:** They define signal routing across ECUs for CAN, LIN, or Ethernet networks.

**Q7. Whatâ€™s the use of .arxml files in system design?**  
**A:** These describe AUTOSAR software components and interfaces for integration across tools.

**Q8. What is signal interface mismatch during integration?**  
**A:** It happens when signal names, data types, or sizes don't match across systems or components.

**Q9. How is consistency maintained during system-level development?**  
**A:** Through version control, interface agreements, and continuous integration testing.

**Q10. What are safety considerations during system integration?**  
**A:** Proper diagnostics, redundancy, signal validation, and watchdog implementations.
